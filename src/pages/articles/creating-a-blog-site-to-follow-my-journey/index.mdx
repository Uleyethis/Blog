As a way to keep my engaged and motivated in learning to create games; I decided 
to create a blog.

<Image src={designBlog} alt="Image showing a part of the main page of my blog" />

This would work as a way for me to learn new things in web development, which is 
what I do for a living. But, also it would keep me motivated to continue in my goal 
of learning to create my own video games. I am hoping that the want to regularly
post blog posts with tidbits of information I learn along the way will keep me 
engaged with continuing to push forward.

## Initial design

So I am going to be real here design is not my strong suit. Making a good looking 
website takes a certain skill set that as of now eludes me. Thankfully, there are 
many other people in the world that are way better at it than I will ever be. One 
of these groups is Tailwind. 

Mostly known for their CSS framework, Tailwind also has developed some really nice, 
clean, and esthetically pleasing components and website templates. One of these 
templates is called Spotlight, which is what I am using for this blog.
