As a way to keep my engaged and motivated in learning to create games; I decided 
to create a blog.

<Image src={designBlog} alt="Image showing a part of the main page of my blog" />

This would work as a way for me to learn new things in web development, which is 
what I do for a living. But, also it would keep me motivated to continue in my goal 
of learning to create my own video games. I am hoping that the want to regularly
post blog posts with tidbits of information I learn along the way will keep me 
engaged with continuing to push forward.

## Initial design

So I am going to be real here design is not my strong suit. Making a good looking 
website takes a certain skill set that as of now eludes me. Thankfully, there are 
many other people in the world that are way better at it than I will ever be. One 
of these groups is Tailwind. 

Mostly known for their CSS framework, Tailwind also has developed some really nice, 
clean, and esthetically pleasing components and website templates. One of these 
templates is called Spotlight, which is what I am using for this blog.

## Repository and hosting

The next step was getting my template set up as a repository in github. This was very 
simple, I basically just loaded up the template in Visual Studio Code and published 
to Github. Bam, main branch created.

As the site is written in Next.JS and uses MDX for the blog articles I now needed to 
set up Github to build the site, and publish to github-pages. The build would create 
a static site version of the website and output that content into the /out/ folder. 
This is the default build action by Next. Luckily, the default GitHub Action for a 
Next deployment is already set up to set up the environment, and build the project.

This is where my first hurdle came in. During the build process the next build was 
erroring out when it was trying to compile the MDX files. For those unaware, MDX files 
are simply Markdown files that allow react JSX components to be used in the markdown code 
to allow some dynamic content to be used in a markdown file.

This was a head-scratcher for while as the site was building and running perfectly fine 
on my local machine ( that's what they all say!). Luckily after walking through the 
automation workflow, the YAML file generated by github, I was able to determine that the 
build environment was being generated but using its own next.ocnfig.js file, and not the 
one included in my repository, so the fix was very simple. I added the 'generator_config_file' 
attribute to tell the build process to use the next config file included in the repository instead.

```c
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v3
        with:
          # Automatically inject basePath in your Next.js configuration file and disable
          # server side image optimization (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#unoptimized).
          #
          # You may remove this line if you want to manage the configuration yourself.
          static_site_generator: next
          generator_config_file: ${{ github.workspace }}/next.config.mjs
```

I now have a repository, where upon the main branch has a new commit, it will create a build environment, 
pull in the repository files, build and package the site, and deploy it to git-hub pages. This will allow 
for more rapid development for any future changes for this blog, and well as allow me to focus on creating 
content (these articles).

This is but merely the first step in this journey, and already I have been learning quite a bit. Even if it 
is not specifically game development learning is fun, so I am looking forward to see where this brings me.
